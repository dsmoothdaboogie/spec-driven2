# Create Tasks

Read:
- `agent-os/specs/<feature>/SPEC.md`
- `agent-os/specs/<feature>/ACCEPTANCE.md`
- `agent-os/standards/*`

Do:
1) Propose minimal additional plan files (UI, services, data, auth, observability, testing/CI).  
2) Output each new `plan.*.md` with tasks, deps, risks, acceptance mapping, explicit file paths.  
**No code.**
